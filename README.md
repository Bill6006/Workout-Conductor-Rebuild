# Workout Conductor

Workout Conductor is a mobile-first, local-first intelligent workout coach. It is being built as a clean application using React, TypeScript, Vite, and a phased review process.

## Live app

## Current scope

Phase 1 adds focused onboarding, editable athlete and training preferences, saved location/equipment profiles, a clearly synthetic Today preview, and a validated local data foundation. Small settings use `localStorage`; durable profile data uses IndexedDB with schema validation and write/read-back verification. Export/import is a deliberately limited foundation for later migration work.

Workout catalog reconciliation and workout generation remain gated to later phases.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the validation suite:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
npm run test:e2e
```

## Privacy

Workout Conductor has no backend, remote authentication, analytics, or telemetry. Real workout history and personal settings stay in the user's browser. Never commit workout exports, backups, private notes, contact information, or real user history.

See [docs/PRIVACY.md](docs/PRIVACY.md) for repository and application data rules.

## Phase gate

Each phase is committed, deployed, tested, and marked **YELLOW** for Android review. Only the user can approve the next phase with `GREEN - NEXT PHASE`.
